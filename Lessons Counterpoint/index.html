            <h1 class="big-h1">Counterpoint</h1>
            <h1>Overview</h1>
            <p>Counterpoint is the art of composing separate melodic lines to be played simultaneously. The melodies
                must adhere to a specific set of rules and harmonic practices developed throughout the Renaissance and
                Baroque periods by composers such as Palestrina, Bach, and Fux. The melodies must have a sense of
                structure and melodic direction independently, while functioning properly in unison. This can be thought
                of as the <strong>horizontal</strong> and <strong>vertical</strong> quality of the counterpoint. </p>
            <h1>Harmony</h1>
            <p>Contrapuntal composition begins most often with a '<em>cantus firmus</em>', abbreviated as 'c.f.' and
                Latin for 'given melody' or 'fixed melody', a melodic line for the counterpoint to be composed against.
                To compose a line of counterpoint the melody is written either above, or below, the cantus firmus.
                <em>The quality of the interaction between the two lines at any given point is assessed by the harmonic
                    interval made between each line on the same beat.</em> Or simply put, the space between the notes of
                each line. This interval is examined from the lower of the two notes upward, and is categorized into one
                of twelve harmonic intervals. <em>All counterpoint harmony favors consonant intervals over dissonant
                    ones.</em> There are six consonant intervals, and six dissonant ones.

            <p>However these intervals cannot be moved through aimlessly. Perfect fifths and octaves must be approached
                from <strong class="yellow">contrary motion</strong> and there can be no more than two thirds or sixths
                of any kind played repeatedly. </p>
            <blockquote>
                <h4>A note on fourths.</h4>
                <p>In a modern context the perfect fourth is considered a strong consonance rather than a strong
                    dissonance. As its use, and perception, have shifted over time. In fact, harmony centered around
                    fourths can be incredibly compelling and expressive. However, if you wish to compose in a more
                    modern or jazz context more rules must be learned and altered than just the addition of an interval.

            <p>The severity of how strictly one should adhere to these intervals depends on the style and genre of the
                counterpoint they are composing. <em>The quality of the harmonic intervals between lines can be thought
                    of as the '<strong>vertical strength</strong>' of the piece, as harmony is notated vertically at any
                    given point.</em> There are other harmonic principles for counterpoint composed in a harmonic minor
                or other modal context; the above rules apply mostly for counterpoint composed in the major modes.</p>
            <h1>Melody</h1>
            <p>There are three types of melodic motion for the movement of the voices to be categorized within in
                contrapuntal pieces: </p>

                        motion</strong>, and the overall shape of the counterpoint should be contrary to the cantus

            <p> The counterpoint cannot cross melodic paths with the cantus firmus (i.e. the upper voice plays below a
                given note of the lower voice, or the lower plays above the upper voice).</p>

            <p><em>The caliber of the melody can be thought of as its '<strong>horizontal strength</strong>', as a
                    melody unfolds horizontally through the notation.</em></p>
            <p>Counterpoint is categorized into 'species'. There are five species of counterpoint, starting with First
                Species.</p>
