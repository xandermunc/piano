# Imitative Counterpoint in G Minor - Op. 1

The top voice states the theme in G Harmonic Minor: three repetitions of the fifth followed by a jump down to the root. The bottom voice responds with the answer: the root, a half-step down and back up, and a jump down by a fourth to the fifth. The statement and answer are transposed to D Harmonic Minor, the dominant key to G. With the statement and answer taking place in the same voices at the same places in the measure as in the first measure. The variation comes in with the octave that the themes are being placed in. As well as the lines that connect the themes.
