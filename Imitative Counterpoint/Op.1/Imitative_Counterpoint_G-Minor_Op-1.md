# Imitative Counterpoint in G Minor - Op. 1

The top voice states the theme in G Harmonic Minor: three repetitions of the fifth followed by a jump down to the root. The bottom voice responds with the answer: the root, a half-step down and back up, and a jump down to the fifth by a fourth. The statement and answer are transposed to D Harmonic Minor, the dominant key of G. With the statement and answer occurring at the same place in each measure as in the first measure. The variation comes with the octave that the themes are being play in. As well as the lines that connect the themes. 

## Notes

In measure one I let the repetition of the three thirds pass as valid, as the first third is major and the following two are minor. In a Harmonic Minor context passing through alternating thirds in succession feels fitting. However, In most other contexts I would avoid more than two thirds in a row. 

Also in measure one I resolve the jump down to the root by a jump up a minor third. This would be avoidable if not for it outlining the chord's triad. In most cases I would resolve a leap of a fifth with stepwise motion in the opposite direction. I use the same chord outline in measure two and three. And in measure four I jump downward a second time following the leap from the fifth to land on the Bb, the same note on the same beat as in the other G minor measures, to outline the chord change. The repetition of this rule break lends it credibility as a musical decision.
